//C# rundown crashcourse
//data types
//record can't be mutated. good for handling sensitive datas
//struct are for storing primitive types, this exist in the execution of the program and not stored in memory.

//class types
//public class is basically can be used everywhere
//private class is only available in that specific class it was initialized on
//protected is declaring scope of everthing that is inherit from it
//internal just the assembly
//file means just this file

//void means no value to return
//static runs once but you need to use static on all your functions

//int arr[] = new int[] 
//just use list for dynamic size
//List<int> list = new list<int>()
//list.add(5) or list.remove(1)

//foreach(int index in list){}
